# jf.scripts

Scripts and one liners because copy/paste is a great way to get carpal tunnel syndrome.

### lunch.php

Any number of users on a team can quickly and easily override the PD schedule for an hour starting immediately or in 5 minutes.  I found these two use cases the most predominant.

### api_token_template.py

Just a function to add to any script that uses an API key to get work done.  It ensures a minimum level of security for keys stored in plaintext.
